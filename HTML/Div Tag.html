	<b> If you die before me
I would jump down into your grave
and hug you so innocently
that angels will become jealous.

I shall kiss you.
So intimately shall I kiss you
that your breath becomes mine.
In one breath of love shall 
we merge into hugs of true joy.

Your heart shall beat
in rhythms unheard
like the drums of the desert
and the wild forest in the night.

You shall murmur in my ears: 
'Oh press me to your chest; 
Tear open your chest, 
Make way for me 
to enter into your loving heart
that beats only for me in resounding colors.

Tell me please Oh my lover
Is it a rainbow that I see? 
or the glow of a burning pyre? 
Why is it that I cannot utter it in words? 
Tell me glorious angels of love: 
What am I experiencing in uncountable
moments of indescribable inner comfort? 


Shivering in your presence
I shall long to dance with you.

If the dark souls lead you to Hades
I will dance and dance with you
even in the nether world.

We shall dance soft and then wild.
We shall dance together
as one body and soul 
and break the fetters of hell
through love that emanates from our dance.

Dance so long and fine like a poem
until the Lords of the dark would faint.

Breaking the fetters of Hades
the white angels attired in beauty
shall fly down to pick you up on golden cradles
and carry you to the world of God.

So you will be free and fly away 
from me into the world of the heavens
where angels shall kiss your sacred body.
You will be attired in gold and white
and in varied colors in tune 
with the flowers of heaven.

Then you need no space to live and breathe.

Into that world of purity you will go
and I will be here on earth
dreaming of your joys with 
the Heavenly spirits.

Shall I wait? 

Shall I wait at dusk and dawn
in sobs and a heaving heart
with such desire and passion
to reach you one day 
in your world of happiness.

(It is the belief that once your lady love dies before you, she has to go to the Hades and there she has to dance so fiercely and lovingly to make the Lords of Darkness faint and then she shall be free from the chains of hell.
Here the living lover is ready to go to hell to dance with her most fiercely and save her from the hell)</b>
